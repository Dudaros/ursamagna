Dracula is a name that transcends ages and media, synonymous with vampires. However, it wasn’t the first book about vampires, nor were its ideas entirely original. Many of the themes and elements in _Dracula_ can be found in earlier works and folklore. Yet, this novel solidified the modern persona of the vampire.

Interestingly, most people know Dracula not from the original book but through various adaptations in other media. Reading the novel might surprise them, as it is set in a much more modern environment and time than they might expect. It’s a world where photography already exists and is used, giving it a unique juxtaposition of the supernatural and the technological.

The book is written in an epistolary format, meaning everything is presented as journal entries, telegrams, or newspaper articles. While this approach grounds the story in a sense of realism, it can feel a bit stiff and overly detailed. Events are often tied to specific dates, and the overlapping accounts from different characters can feel repetitive, as they recount the same events from their perspectives. While this technique enhances immersion, it’s debatable whether the payoff justifies the density.

One of the most fascinating aspects of the novel is its depiction of a world that starts to resemble ours in certain ways. It’s a world shaped by speed and technology, where science and logic clash with folklore and superstition. This contrast highlights humanity’s craving for mystery and mysticism in an increasingly rational world.

I’d like to explore how the train and the telegraph are portrayed in the novel as new means of connectivity. These innovations made the world feel smaller and more interconnected, serving as precursors to the hyper-connected reality we live in today.

### Plot Summary

The story begins with Jonathan Harker, a solicitor from England, who travels to Transylvania to meet Count Dracula and finalize the details of the Count’s move to England. As Harker approaches his destination, his journey becomes increasingly strange, gradually introducing us to the horrors ahead.

We are introduced to Dracula, though the novel never provides his perspective. Harker eventually finds himself imprisoned in Dracula’s castle with his fate uncertain, while Dracula departs for England by ship, ready to “invade” this new land. England, with its societal advancements and technologies, is vastly different from Dracula’s homeland. The Count, however, has spent considerable time studying and preparing for this transition.

Meanwhile, we meet Mina, Harker’s fiancée, and her friend Lucy, a woman admired by many suitors. The two women are in Whitby when they witness the arrival of Dracula’s ship during a storm. Following his arrival, strange events begin to unfold, particularly around Lucy.

Lucy’s fiancé, Arthur, is introduced, along with Dr. Seward, the head of a psychiatric clinic, who is studying Renfield, a zoophagous patient with peculiar behaviors. Another key figure is Lord Godalming, adding complexity to the relationships surrounding Lucy.

As Dracula begins to visit Lucy in secret, her health deteriorates, though she does not recognize or acknowledge the cause. Eventually, her friends seek help from Dr. Van Helsing, a brilliant scientist with an open mind toward the unexplained. Despite their efforts, a series of unfortunate decisions and circumstances lead to Lucy’s death. However, her fate is worse than death—she becomes a vampire. The group ultimately destroys her by decapitating her and driving a stake through her heart.

Determined to confront Dracula, the group intensifies their efforts. Meanwhile, Mina begins to experience unsettling changes, hinting at a deepening connection with Dracula.
